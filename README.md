Kong Siu Hei, Chan Cheuk Wai

## Remarks for TAs:
Please don't use Image Pool folder for loading images (That folder only stores 10 x 10 images for mosaic)
For applying kernel and mosaic, the program lags a lot because of the run time, please click the UI to let it load.
For impressionist, expressionist stuff, please wait for the program to run after clicking OK or else it might crash (Maybe our computers are too weak).
